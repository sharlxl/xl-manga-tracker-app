# XL-Manga-Tracker-App
A React.js based App to help keep track your manga reading progress, for all avid manga readers out there like me.
Styled with TailwindCSS

## Motivation
This app was created from my love for reading mangas/manhwas.
Being an avid reader of these mediums, the publications for ongoing comics can vary, or you might want to take a short rest from following the chapters weekly and binge read when it has reach a certain amount.
This adds the functionality of recording your reading progress and help to keep track of where you stopped and easily refer to where you have left off.

## Future implementation

- Store the chapters you enter into your reading list.
- Able to add a bookmark to a manga you are interested in.
- Expand the Search function to include Manhwa and Light Novels.
